## Quantum Speedup for Minimum Steiner Tree
I carried out a research on MSTs, and the quantum algorithm which incorporated Grover's Search along with Dynamic Programming is found to have the <b>best time complexity. </b>
O(1.812^k) where k is the number of terminals. 

This is the demo implementation of the same using Qiskit library, although the full algorithm has not been implemented anywhere publicly.
